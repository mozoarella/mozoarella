### Hello
Please do not be alarmed by the lack of repositories or commits. I don't really use github because I find gitlab to be better in almost every single way. Hoever I may decide to fork project on github if there's projects I want to contribute to. But any projects I start myself are either on a gitea instance or my [Gitlab profile](https://gitlab.com/dylantic).

I rarely do software development because I'm more into automation and operations. So if you ever have to prepare an Nginx configuration or want your cool new application to also run in a Docker container feel free to hit me up :)

I'm also interested in automated provisioning through ansible and chef and the likes, don't have a lot of experience there but I'm always willing to lend a hand.
