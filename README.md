### Hello
Please do not be alarmed by the lack of repositories or commits. I don't really use github because I find gitlab to be better in almost every single way. However I may decide to fork project on github if there's projects I want to contribute to. But any projects I start myself are either on a gitea instance or my [Gitlab profile](https://gitlab.com/dylantic).

Also check out [my website :)](https://dylanmaassen.nl)
