Hiya, I'm Dylan. I work on part of the platform of a bank. They call me an 'engineer' but that's fairly vague and too fancy for me, honestly.  

I know a fair bit about Linux and how to safely run web services. Learning about more modern ways to manage infrastructure and applications.

Currently working on some personal projects to do with TLS and server certificates. Along with the odd program to scratch one of my many itches. I do like to program in Go quite a bit, but I'm definitely not a pro yet. I am quite interested in CI/CD pipelines and mostly experimenting with them on GitLab,but I suppose GitHub Actions are pretty neat too.

Slowly but surely getting started on writing content for [my blog](https://dylans.blog), the source is currently on GitLab, but I'll probably move it over at some point. It's currently on Cloudflare Pages, and sadly they don't allow you to change the connected repository yet.  

Also got [my main website](https://dylanmaassen.nl) which I'm quite happy about how well it turned out. It's a little bit inspired by the dialog windows from Stardew Valley. And by a little bit I mean a lotta bit.
